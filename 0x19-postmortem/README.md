## Overview
Date and time of the incident: 2021-01-01 10:00 AM UTC
Duration of the incident: 2 hours
List of affected services:
    Web application: complete outage
    Database server: degraded performance
Impact on users: During the 2-hour outage, users were unable to access the web application, and experienced slow performance when accessing the database server.
## Root Cause Analysis
Detailed analysis of the cause of the incident: The root cause of the outage was a network connectivity issue between the web application and the database server. The issue was caused by a failure in the firewall that was routing traffic between the two systems.
Contributing factors: The failure was caused by a configuration error that was introduced during a recent upgrade of the firewall software. The error was not detected during testing and was only discovered after the failure occurred.
System reliability and stability: The web application and database server are both critical systems and their reliability and stability is essential for the smooth operation of the business. An assessment of the systems reveals that they are generally stable and reliable, but the recent network connectivity issue highlights the need for improved monitoring and testing processes.
## Corrective and Preventive Measures
Actions taken to resolve the incident and restore service: To resolve the outage, the configuration error in the firewall was corrected and the firewall was restarted. The web application and database server were then tested to ensure that they were functioning correctly.
Permanent fixes: To prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future, the following actions will be taken:
    Review and update the firewall configuration management process to ensure that configuration changes are thoroughly tested before deployment.
    Improve monitoring of the firewall and the web application and database servers to detect connectivity issues more quickly.
    Regularly test the network connectivity between the web application and database server to ensure that it is working correctly.
Feasibility and impact of proposed fixes: The proposed fixes are feasible and will have a positive impact on the reliability and stability of the systems. The cost of implementing the fixes is acceptable and the benefits outweigh the costs.
## Communication and Lessons Learned
Internal and external communication: During the incident, internal teams were notified and worked together to resolve the issue. External users were notified of the outage via the company's website and social media channels, and updates were provided as the incident progressed.
Lessons learned: The incident has highlighted the following lessons:
    The importance of thoroughly testing configuration changes before deployment.
    The need for improved monitoring and testing processes to ensure the reliability and stability of critical systems.
    The importance of regular communication with users during outages to keep them informed of the situation.
